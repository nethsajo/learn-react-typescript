I. State
	- The most important concept in React
	- Data that a component can hold over time, necessart for information that it needs to remember throughout the app's lifecycle
	- We can think of state as being the memory of a component
        - A Component State is a single local component variable ("piece of state", "state variable")
	  - "State variable" / "piece of state" - A single variable in a component (component state)
	  - Basically, the general term state is all the pieces of state together.
        - Updating component state triggers React to re-render the component
